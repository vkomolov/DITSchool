The pack of courses at "PHP-Academy": https://php-academy.kiev.ua

The idea was to comprise learning subjects and home tasks in one project.
The design of the site is not an issue.
The priority laid on realisation of methods learned.
I tried to experiment with universal CSS classes for all pages. 
Strive for resticting myself from giving separate class to each DOM element.
Desire to reuse the classes from one page to another one. It gives possibility to use a type of primitive CSS constructor.
The site is expected to be upgraded during the stages of courses. So, the level of knowledge and the background can be different on the time periods.


Sincerely,
