            "I have successfully worked in the field of B2B sales for more than 20 years: from a sales manager of the industrial and high-tech products to the sales director for the international production company.",

            "Many apps suffer not only adaptability to devices, but also their imbalance in programming, using 'big' for the 'little' or just not fully relevent to the task and possible Customer Priorities",
            "In addition, the growing trend in use of different constructors, libraries simplify the web production, but also can restrain freedom and creativity at the same time.",
            "I learn to feel the balance in usage of the front and back methods when creating an application with a specific purpose and functionality.",
            "I enjoy and strive for an easy, scalable and maximum adaptive, semantic DRY code, not overloaded with many libraries for a couple of easy methods.",
            "I am certainly convinced, that my professional background in management of sales and marketing processes will meet my lively interest in web programming and generate a productive, significant outcome for the Company I will work for.",
